# Frequently Asked Questions 🤔 🤔

if you can't see the React tab in my dev tools?

Restart your dev tools or your chrome browser entirely. They will only show up when you are viewing a React app - so make sure you test it on Facebook or another website that is running React. It won't work on your empty `main.js` file until you `import React from 'react'`.

`npm start` doesn't update the app on file save, or doesn't run correctly ?

There may be a few different causes for this:

- Webpack currently can't handle folder/file names that contain parentheses.
- Webpack also has problems running inside folders for Dropbox/Google Drive type services. Git is recommended for keeping your files in sync across multiple computers.

Be sure to select "Realtime database" as as your database type inside Firebase. If you created your database as a Cloud Firestore type, you can change it in the Database tab.
